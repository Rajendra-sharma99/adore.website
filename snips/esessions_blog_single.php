                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">nteraction and facilitation are two of the most important skills to conduct education and
                        outreach sessions on various significant issues. Adore volunteers connect with children at
                        schools and childrenâ€™s homes to conduct interactive sessions on matters that they usually
                        find difficult to understand or discuss with their parents and teachers. The interactions
                        cater to learning outcomes in students at a knowledge-based, emotion-based and action-based
                        level.
                        The idea is to engage all students during the interactions and not just the extrovert few.</p>


                    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;" >These sessions are around various important topics like Child Safety, How to Overcome Fear,
                        General
                        Awareness, Public Speaking Sessions, Career Choice, Managing Peer Pressure, Health and Hygiene,
                        Respecting Elders, Teenage Issues, Personality Development and many more.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">We familiarize the students with some of the crucial topics by discussing and enticing them with
                    engaging and challenging discussion questions which creates essential classroom learning
                    opportunities.
